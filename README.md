## 🔍 Executive Summary

This portfolio project presents an end-to-end **Inventory Management & Reorder Optimization system** developed using **Advanced Microsoft Excel**.  
The solution simulates a real-world inventory environment and focuses on monitoring stock levels, analyzing demand behavior, and optimizing reorder decisions to reduce stockouts and excess inventory.

The project integrates structured datasets, analytical calculations, and an interactive dashboard to support **data-driven operational decision-making**.

## 🏭 Business Problem

In inventory-driven businesses, lack of visibility into demand and stock levels often leads to:

- ❌ Frequent stockouts  
- ❌ Excess inventory holding costs  
- ❌ Inefficient and delayed reorder decisions  

This project addresses these challenges by combining **demand analysis, lead time, cost parameters, and reorder logic** into a single analytical framework.

## 🗂️ Data Structure & Model Design

### 1️⃣ Product Master
- Product ID & Name  
- Category  
- Supplier  
- Unit Cost  
- Lead Time  
- Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)  
- Holding & Ordering cost assumptions  

---

### 2️⃣ Inventory Transactions
- IN / OUT movement tracking  
- Transaction date  
- Quantity  
- Location  

This table serves as the base for all inventory calculations.

---

### 3️⃣ Inventory Status
- Current stock calculation  
- Inventory value  
- Stock classification (Sufficient / Reorder / Out of Stock)  

Conditional formatting is used for instant visual alerts.

---

### 4️⃣ Demand Analysis
- Average daily demand  
- Monthly demand  
- Maximum daily demand  

Demand is derived from historical transaction data.

---

### 5️⃣ Reorder Optimization
- Safety stock calculation  
- Reorder point determination  
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)  
- Reorder flag and urgency indicator  

---

## 📊 Core Analysis Performed

- Net inventory calculation using IN / OUT logic  
- Demand aggregation using Pivot Tables  
- Safety stock estimation based on demand and lead time  
- Reorder point calculation  
- EOQ-based order quantity optimization  
- Inventory gap analysis (current stock vs reorder level)  

All calculations are dynamic and update automatically with filters.
